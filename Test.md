Let's check what this can do.

Table 1.

|A	|B	|C	|
|:---|:---|:---|
|D	|E	|F|
|Short column|Yet another short column|And here we should have a column with **lots and lots of text**, so much indeed that it would break the bounds.<br/>That much even that there will be multiple lines.<br/><br/>Multiple paragraphs!<br/>The text needs to be formattable, *emphasised*, made **bold**, it all needs to work flawlessly.|
| |Let's put another subheading|And here's one more big column. I really, really don't want to bring any "Lorem ipsum" text, as I hate bad Latin. Latin should be used as Latin, not as some mock language, like High Gothic, if you get my meaning.|
